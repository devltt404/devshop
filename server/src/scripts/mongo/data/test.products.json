At ROG, we&#8217;re never afraid to push the boundaries of PC design or performance, and the G22 is the latest example of our pursuit of excellence. Cooling is key in any small form factor case, so the ROG G22CH has a more traditional air-cooled solution to keep the processor running smoothly, without excessive fan noise, despite the 10L chassis size. As a compact machine, the ROG G22CH can happily sit on even the smallest desks. The chassis was designed with personalization in mind, with multiple side panel options and full Aura Sync RGB compatibility.",

Inside there are two full-range drivers angled to deliver wide, spatial sound, while the center tweeter specifically focuses on clarifying speech. And built-in Dolby decoding enhances the audio capabilities of your TV Speaker to deliver a more realistic and satisfying listening experience. Designed with simplicity in mind, a single connection to your TV has you up and running in no time. This connection can be either an optical audio cable (included) or an HDMI cable (sold separately). At just over 2&#8243; (5 cm) tall, this TV Speaker is small enough to fit just about anywhere. Place it in front of your TV or mount it to the wall. Plus small LED lights on the front turn on and/or change color when certain features are enabled or when the volume is adjusted. The Bose TV Speaker also has HDMI-CEC, which allows the TV and soundbar to communicate when connected by an HDMI cable. So when you turn the TV on, the soundbar will automatically turn on too, and you can even continue using your current TV remote to control the volume of the soundbar. However, the Bose TV Speaker also has its own remote. On it, you can pair your Bluetooth device to wirelessly stream your favorite music or podcasts, enable Dialogue Mode to further elevate center vocals, or add a bass boost for some extra depth. And the Bose TV Speaker is Roku TV Ready certified. Meaning, it&#8217;s designed to work seamlessly with a Roku TV. When connected to a Roku TV via an HDMI cable, you&#8217;ll enjoy smooth, automatic setup, easy access to the TV Speaker sound settings in the Roku TV on-screen menu, and compatibility with the Roku TV remote. If you&#8217;re looking for even more bass or just want to expand your system, you can add a subwoofer for more theater-quality home theater sound. The Bose TV Speaker requires a wired connection and is compatible with the Bose Bass Module 500 or 700 (Bose Bass Module Connection Cable sold separately).",

  "description": "Experience a new dimension of sound that truly surrounds with the new M-Series 5.1.2 Home Theater Sound Bar with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X from VIZIO, America&#8217;s #1 Sound Bar Brand. Its 11 high-performance speakers with separate tweeters and woofers deliver pristine clarity and ample volume. Inside the sound bar are two upfiring speakers&#8212;the key to Dolby Atmos and DTS:X cinema sound&#8212;that reflect accurate overhead audio off your ceiling to deliver life-like 3D surround sound that complements today&#8217;s 4K picture quality. A dedicated center speaker assures crisp, clear dialogue within a smoother front soundstage, and the adjustable Dialogue Enhancement EQ further increases vocal clarity so you can hear every word. A pair of discreet surround speakers with volume EQ fills any room from front or back, plus the mighty 6&#8221; wireless subwoofer rocks the house on movie night with deep bass that really booms. With the M-Series 5.1.2, Dolby Atmos and DTS:X soundtracks bring cinema-quality overhead surround to movies at home, and video games now have heart-pounding, life-like 3D sound that comes from all around you&#8212;even from above&#8212;so you can hear every detail and immerse yourself like never before. This is the difference between watching and truly losing yourself in the moment. And for non-Atmos/DTS:X content, DTS Virtual:X adds thrilling floor-to-ceiling virtualized sound, putting you in the middle of the action or front row at the finest concert hall. The sound bar is designed to deliver the highest possible audio/video quality from all connected sources, with HDMI eARC that enables cutting-edge 4K Dolby Vision pass-through to the TV. (An HDMI cable and all audio cables are included right in the box.) This feature also lets you control the sound bar with your TV remote. Its modern, low-profile style features an easy-to-clean charcoal gray texture that&#8217;s ideal for any living space. For an equally elegant, hands-free smart experience, the M-Series 5.1.2 is also Voice Assistant-ready, so you can connect your own voice assistant (sold separately) and operate it right through the sound bar for upgraded audio. And for further wireless ease, stream your favorite playlist from your phone with Bluetooth. With these advanced features and its cinema-quality surround sound, the VIZIO M-Series 5.1.2 Home Theater Sound Bar with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X lets you bring home the true movie theater experience like never before.",

  "description": "Imagine having the magic of a movie theater right in your home and feeling totally immersed in every scene. With the Bose Smart Soundbar 900 with Dolby Atmos, you can. Custom-engineered upfiring dipole speakers work with advanced Bose technologies to make it seem like your room is filled with sound from every direction. Even overhead. It&#8217;s like you can almost feel the rain coming down during your favorite movie. For content that isn&#8217;t encoded in Dolby Atmos, proprietary TrueSpace spatial processing intelligently analyzes signals other than Dolby Atmos, like stereo or 5.1 surround sound system, and upmixes them to create an immersive 7-channel speaker wireless surround sound experience with an impressive sense of height in the soundscape. The result is enveloping sound with convincing realism no matter what you watch with this TV soundbar. But it&#8217;s not just the sound quality that you&#8217;ll notice with this Dolby Atmos soundbar. Material quality. Construction. Finishes. Controls. Every detail was obsessed over to produce a Bose premium soundbar that looks as beautiful as it sounds. And with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant built in, you can create a connected home theater system. This Bluetooth soundbar helps you control all your entertainment, manage your day, and get information &#8212; using just your voice.",

  "description": "Despite the HD 660S&#8217;s standing as one of the world&#8217;s popular audiophile headphones, some customers nevertheless wanted one very specific enhancement: even deeper bass. Because whether it&#8217;s a thunderous crescendo of timpani or the pulsating beat of electronic dance music, there is nothing like accurate, powerful sub bass to infuse your listening with drama. Audiophiles&#8212;and anyone looking for comfortable, non-fatiguing, high-end headphones&#8212;can now get even more impact and emotion from the HD 660S2. The headphone&#8217;s warm, relaxed tone is reflected by their timeless styling with elegant bronze accents. With its open-back design and outstanding comfort, the HD 660S2 is also destined to be a favorite for long listening sessions. This version builds on all the strengths of its formidable predecessor. The same world-class precision and resolution still let you pick out individual instruments like with no other headphone. Or experience the joy of discovering sonic details in recordings you&#8217;ve known for years&#8212;now underscored with more and deeper low end. Indeed, the standard-setter for extended listening has now become the standard-setter for extended bass as well. Enhancing this heralded audio design without detracting from its many strengths was, however, a daunting task. So, our engineers set out to systematically identify and exploit every opportunity in their quest to improve on the acclaimed HD 660S design. We adjusted the compliance of the surround, for instance, dropping the resonance frequency to 70 Hz. Considerable effort went into optimizing the airflow around the transducer. The coil in the HD 660S2 has also been revised to match the legendary HD 600 & 650, resulting in an impedance of 300 ohms. The coil offers a high magnetic force and electrical damping for a clean impulse response. It also increases sensitivity over the entire frequency spectrum by using the magnet&#8217;s air gap more efficiently. Taken together, these efforts and more have paid off in spades. Sound pressure at the lowest octaves has doubled. Now, you can feel the music more than ever before&#8212;with all the depth and weight that ultra-low frequencies invoke. The lowest A on the piano (27.5 Hz) or the pounding root note of a bass drum (45-60 Hz) are just as big, expansive, and imposing as if they were live. The unique combination of impactful bass combined with the warm tuning and smooth treble will be a revelation for audiophile listeners. It&#8217;s an even better way to lose yourself in comfortable, non-fatiguing, high-end sound&#8212;while feeling its full low-end power.",
